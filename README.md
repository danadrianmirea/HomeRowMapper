# HomeRowMapper
This is an autohotkey script that disables the normal operation of the caps lock key, and uses it as a toggle to remap a-z 
keys to other keys. This is useful in conjunction with a keyboard that has a trackpoint and it allows the user to rest his 
hands on the home row 99% of the time. 

Should be straightforward to understand/edit to your liking if desired.
